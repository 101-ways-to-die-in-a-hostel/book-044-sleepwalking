## The Hostel

**Name:** Casa Colonial Backpackers
**Type:** Boutique/Historic Backpacker Hostel
**Star Rating:** 4 stars
**Price Range:** 45,000-120,000 COP per night ($12-30 USD)

### History
A 200-year-old colonial mansion converted to a hostel in 2010. Originally built for a Spanish merchant family, later used as a convent, then abandoned for decades before restoration. The building has "character" - which means beautiful archways, thick walls, and questionable safety features that predate modern codes. There are rumors of ghost sightings (the nuns, supposedly) that the hostel leans into for marketing.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Spanish colonial, white-washed walls, internal courtyard, wrought-iron balconies
- **Floors:** 5 floors around central courtyard (no elevator)

### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
The fifth-floor balcony: A narrow wrought-iron balcony (1.5m deep, 4m wide) accessible through a wooden door at the end of the hallway. The door is routinely propped open for air circulation and smokers. The railing is original ironwork - beautiful but only 90cm high (modern code requires 110cm minimum). The balcony overlooks Calle de la Moneda, a narrow colonial street with cobblestone paving. The fall point to impact is approximately 15 meters.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Diego Herrera
**Description:** 24, local who's worked here since the hostel opened, speaks English, French, and some German. Friendly but jaded. Has seen a lot of guest drama.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - followed all (inadequate) standard procedures

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Rosa | 50s, has worked here since convent days, superstitious about "the spirits" |
| Night Security | Carlos | Supposed to do rounds but usually sleeps in the courtyard |
| Bar/Kitchen | Valentina | Young bartender, heard strange sounds from fifth floor that night but assumed it was guests hooking up |
| Manager | American (expat Brian) | Rarely present, more interested in profits than safety upgrades |

### Staff Knowledge
Rosa claims she's heard footsteps on the fifth floor at night before - attributed to the "ghost nuns." Carlos has found guests on balconies sleepwalking before but just guided them back inside. No one thought to report it or change procedures. After the incident, they'll claim they "had no way of knowing" despite obvious structural dangers.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Lazy, humid, recovery mode. Guests sweating in hammocks or escaping to air-conditioned museums. Coffee on the courtyard, breakfast chatter. The hostel is peaceful, beautiful, photogenic. Everyone takes pictures of the courtyard.

### Night Vibe
The rooftop bar comes alive. Pre-gaming before heading out to the walled city's clubs. Late returns, quiet footsteps on stairs. The balcony doors propped open for the sea breeze. The hostel becomes a maze of dark hallways and sleeping bodies.

### Guest Demographics
20-35 age range. Solo travelers, couples, small groups. Americans, Europeans, some Australians. Digital nomads staying weeks, backpackers passing through. Most are more interested in the rooftop bar than the colonial history.

### Reputation
"Best vibes in Cartagena" per travel blogs. Known for rooftop bar, colonial charm, and Instagram-worthy architecture. Some reviews mention "quirky old building problems" (no elevator, hot water issues, that door that doesn't lock right). No safety reviews.

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Flights to Rafael Nunez International, taxi or Uber to walled city, walk through narrow streets. The hostel is hard to find first time - GPS puts you on the wrong street.

### Check-in Process
Standard hostel process. Passport copy, payment, brief orientation. NO mention of balcony access or safety protocols. Guests sign a generic liability waiver no one reads.

### Rules
1. Quiet hours midnight-8 AM (loosely enforced)
2. No outside alcohol in common areas
3. Rooftop closes at 2 AM
4. Balcony doors should be closed at night (rarely enforced)
5. "Be respectful of the historic building" (meaningless)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: good in common areas, spotty in rooms)
- [x] Kitchen (2nd floor, basic)
- [x] Lockers (small, oversubscribed)
- [x] Laundry (same-day service)
- [ ] Pool (no - this is an old building)
- [x] Bar (rooftop, the main attraction)
- [x] Rooftop terrace
- [x] Tours offered (city tours, boat trips)
- [x] Other: Breakfast included, hammocks, "ghost tour" of the building

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Cartagena's walled city is accurately described
- Colonial buildings converted to hostels are common and often lack modern safety features
- Colombian emergency services response time varies
- Balcony falls from hostels are documented occurrences

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Colombia should not be portrayed as inherently dangerous
- Local characters should be fully realized, not stereotypes
- The city's colonial history has complex layers (slavery, conquest) that should be acknowledged
- Colombian hospitality and warmth should be evident in local characters
