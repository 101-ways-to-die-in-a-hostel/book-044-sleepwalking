# Death Scenario

## The Death (Summary)
**Method:** Fall from fifth-floor balcony while sleepwalking
**Category:** Self-Inflicted
**Duration:** Instant (the fall) though the walk took approximately 3 minutes
**Witnesses:** A street vendor sees the fall but not the walk; a dorm mate wakes briefly and sees an empty bed

## Mechanism (Technical)

### The Cause
Massive blunt force trauma from 15-meter fall onto cobblestone street. Death is instantaneous upon impact. No defensive wounds - she never woke up.

### The Setup
- Victim has documented sleepwalking disorder
- Medication has run out three days prior
- Extreme sleep deprivation (common sleepwalking trigger)
- Hostel has open balcony access from every floor
- Balcony doors are not locked at night
- No one in the dorm knows about her condition

### The Trigger
A vivid dream about walking to the ocean. Her unconscious mind navigates from her bunk, through the dorm, down the hall, and out the fifth-floor balcony door.

### The Process
1. REM cycle completes, sleepwalking episode begins around 3:40 AM
2. Sienna's unconscious body rises, exits her bunk
3. Navigates through dark dorm (disturbing no one - sleepwalkers are remarkably quiet)
4. Walks down hallway to balcony door (unlocked per hostel custom for smokers)
5. Opens door, steps onto narrow balcony
6. Continues walking toward what her dream-brain interprets as the ocean
7. Steps over 90cm railing (low by any safety standard)
8. 15-meter fall, approximately 1.7 seconds
9. Impact

## Research Notes
- Sleepwalking (somnambulism) affects 1-15% of adults, often worse when sleep-deprived
- Sleepwalkers can perform complex tasks: opening doors, navigating stairs
- Sleepwalkers typically don't respond to name or show awareness of danger
- Medication disruption is a major trigger for episodes
- Falls are the most common cause of sleepwalking-related death
- There have been multiple documented cases of fatal falls from hotels/apartments during sleepwalking

## Foreshadowing Checklist

### Part 1 (Subtle Hints)
Plant these without drawing attention:
- [ ] Hint 1: Sienna touches the small scar on her forehead when stressed (sleepwalking injury from childhood)
- [ ] Hint 2: Her top bunk preference is noted - old habit from sleepwalking safety
- [ ] Hint 3: She counts exits and doors upon entering any room - ingrained behavior

### Part 2 (Obvious Warnings)
These should be noticed but dismissed:
- [ ] Warning 1: Dorm mate asks "You okay? You look exhausted" - Rationalization: "Just jet lag"
- [ ] Warning 2: She realizes medication is out, considers finding pharmacy - Rationalization: "I've gone without before, it'll be fine"
- [ ] Warning 3: Almost falls asleep standing up at dinner - Rationalization: "I'll sleep well tonight, that's good"
- [ ] Warning 4: A news story about a tourist fall plays on hostel TV - Rationalization: Doesn't even register
- [ ] Warning 5: The balcony doors are propped open when she goes to bed - Rationalization: "I'll be fine, I always am"

### Part 3 (Explicit Danger)
The threat is now undeniable:
- [ ] Moment 1: (In dream) She approaches the water - it's so close now
- [ ] Moment 2: Her body reaches the railing, her hands touch cold metal (doesn't wake her)
- [ ] Moment 3: The step over - for one second she's suspended, then gravity takes over

## The Death Sequence (Full Detail)

### Setup (Chapter 35-37)
Sienna goes to bed at 10 PM, earlier than usual, exhausted. She takes a bottom bunk tonight because someone else has her preferred top. The dorm is full - six beds, five occupied. The balcony door is propped open for airflow. Someone is snoring. Sienna falls into deep, heavy sleep within minutes.

### Trigger (Chapter 38)
3:40 AM. Sienna's brain enters the parasomnia state where the body acts while the conscious mind sleeps. She dreams of a beach - white sand, warm water. In her dream, she can see the ocean just ahead. She needs to get to it. Her body rises.

### The Death (Chapters 39-40)
Write this sequence in full detail:

**The Walk (3:40-3:43 AM):**
Sienna's sleeping body swings out of the bunk. She stands. Her eyes are open but see nothing. A dorm mate stirs, thinks she's going to the bathroom, rolls over. Sienna walks past her bag, past the lockers, to the dorm door. Her hands find the handle. In her dream, she's walking down a path toward the beach.

**The Hallway (3:43 AM):**
Bare feet on cool tile. The hostel is silent except for distant music from somewhere in the old city. Sienna walks with purpose toward the balcony door at the end of the hall. A motion-sensor light flickers on. She doesn't react. In her dream, the sun is warm on her face.

**The Balcony (3:44 AM):**
The door is already ajar. She pushes through. Night air hits her face - cool, salty from the Caribbean nearby. The railing is waist-height on a conscious person, but meaningless to a sleepwalker. In her dream, the water is right there. She can almost touch it. She reaches.

**The Fall (3:44 AM + 1.7 seconds):**
One step. Two. The second step has no floor beneath it. For 1.7 seconds, Sienna falls. This is sometimes when sleepwalkers wake - the sensation of falling. But her sleep-deprived brain doesn't respond fast enough. She doesn't have time to scream. In her dream, she's diving into the warm ocean.

**Final Moment:**
Impact. The cobblestones of Calle de la Moneda. Her body lands in a position that suggests she was mid-stride. Death is instantaneous - massive skull fracture, severed spine. Her eyes are still closed. A street vendor 30 meters away hears the sound but can't process what he's just witnessed.

### Immediate Aftermath
The street vendor finds her. Starts screaming. Hostel wakes within minutes. Her dorm mates realize her bed is empty. Someone calls police. Her phone is still charging by her bunk; it lights up with a text from her brother: "Sleep well sis." The hostel manager reviews the (nonfunctional) security cameras. There's nothing to see except an empty balcony and then, suddenly, absence.

## Sensory Details

### Sight
She never sees the fall. Her eyes are open but unseeing. The last image her waking brain ever processed was the hostel ceiling as she drifted off. In her dream: blue water, white sand, sunlight.

### Sound
The creak of the bunk. The click of door handles. The whisper of night air. Then silence - and then the sound the street vendor will never forget.

### Touch/Pain
The cool tile under her feet. Night air on her skin. The cold metal of the railing. The fall is too quick for pain. Impact is instantaneous.

### Smell
The briny Caribbean air. Old stone of the colonial building. Jasmine blooming somewhere in the night.

### Taste
Nothing. Her mouth dry from sleep.

## The Horror Element
The horror is the disconnection between mind and body. Sienna's sleeping mind was having a beautiful dream while her body walked to its death. The horror is also that no one knew - no one could have stopped her because she never told anyone. Her independence was perfect; her death was perfectly preventable.

## The Comedy Element
The dark irony of someone running away from being treated as fragile dying in exactly the way her family always feared. The absurdity of dying while dreaming of something peaceful. The grim humor of the hostel's "Open all night!" balcony policy. The fact that the medication she needed costs $5 at a Colombian pharmacy.

## Secondary Victims
| Name | Relationship to Main Victim | Death |
|------|---------------------------|-------|
| N/A | N/A | No physical deaths |

(Psychological victims: her mother will never leave the house again; her brother will carry guilt forever; the street vendor requires years of therapy)

## The Cover-Up (if any)
No cover-up - ruled accidental death by sleepwalking. Investigation reveals her medical history. The hostel quietly installs balcony door locks. Her mother's worst fears are confirmed in the most public way possible. Local news runs the story: "Scottish Tourist Falls to Death in Colonial District."

## @HostelReaper Connection
- Graffiti found: "SWEET DREAMS" etched into the balcony railing where she stepped over
- Social media post: "She walked through every door she wanted. Even the last one. #SleepTight #Cartagena"
- Other: @HostelReaper posted a photo of the hostel's open balcony 24 hours before the incident with the caption "Such easy access"

## Writing Notes

### Pacing the Death
The walk should be dreamlike and slow - the reader should feel the eerie disconnection of a body moving without consciousness. The fall itself is instant. The horror is in the approach, not the impact.

### POV During Death
A unique challenge: Sienna isn't conscious for her own death. POV should alternate between:
1. Her dream (peaceful, beautiful, oblivious)
2. Her body's physical actions (clinical, eerie)
3. Brief moments from others (dorm mate who stirs, street vendor who witnesses)

### Graphic Content Level
- 5/10 - The fall itself should be quick, clinical
- Focus on the eerie detachment rather than gore
- The horror is psychological, not physical
