# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Sienna MacBride
**Nickname/Handle:** @SienaWanders (misspelled intentionally for "brand")
**Age:** 29
**Nationality:** Scottish (Edinburgh)
**Occupation:** Freelance Graphic Designer / Aspiring Travel Blogger

## Archetype
**Primary:** Solo Female Traveler / Chronic Illness Denier

**Secondary traits:**
- Fiercely independent to the point of stubbornness
- Has a medical condition she's learned to "manage" by ignoring
- Proving to herself (and her overprotective family) that she can do anything

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Denial / Stubborn Independence

**How it manifests:**
- Refuses to acknowledge her sleepwalking is a serious condition
- Won't tell hostel staff or roommates about her history
- Sees any accommodation of her condition as "letting it win"

**How it kills them:**
Sienna's determination not to be defined or limited by her sleepwalking means she takes no precautions and tells no one, leaving her unconscious self free to navigate a dangerous balcony in an unfamiliar environment.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'4", slim, wiry from all the walking travel requires
- **Hair:** Red (natural, faded from sun), usually in a messy braid
- **Distinguishing features:** Freckles everywhere, pale skin that burns no matter what, small scar on forehead from childhood sleepwalking incident
- **Typical outfit:** Practical travel clothes, always layered, hiking boots even in cities

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Independence - becomes dangerous self-reliance and refusal to ask for help
2. Resilience - becomes denial of real limitations

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Pride - leads to hiding her condition from everyone
2. Distrust of others' concern - leads to dismissing any warnings about her safety

### Pet Peeves
- Being told she "can't" do something
- Overprotective people (especially family)
- People who let health issues define them

### Fears
- Surface fear: Becoming her mother (who never left Scotland, "too fragile")
- Deeper fear: That her family might be right that she's not safe traveling alone

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in Edinburgh with a loving but suffocating family. Diagnosed with severe sleepwalking disorder at age 7 after multiple incidents. Family treated her like glass. Mother has agoraphobia and projected fears onto Sienna. She spent her twenties proving everyone wrong, traveling despite their concerns. The sleepwalking is controlled with medication she sometimes "forgets" to take.

### Why They Travel
To prove she's not her mother. To prove she's not fragile. To have stories that aren't about being sick. Every stamp in her passport is a middle finger to everyone who said she should stay home.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Solo trip through South America, ended up in Cartagena. Chose this hostel for its rooftop bar and "colonial charm." Didn't notice - or chose to ignore - that the building has open-air balcony access from every floor.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Grand," "nae bother," "I'm fine," "sorted," "don't fuss"
- Avoids words like: "Help," "can't," "need," "scared"
- Catchphrases: "I've got it handled" / "It's not a big deal" / "I've been doing this for years"

### Speech Pattern
- Scottish accent that thickens when defensive
- Tends to end statements definitively, closing off discussion
- Uses humor to deflect concern

### Internal Monologue Style
A constant battle between her anxious inner voice (which sounds like her mother) and her defiant traveling self. The anxious voice is always there, but she's gotten very good at drowning it out.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram for photos, occasional blog posts
- **Follower count:** 4,200 (slowly growing)
- **Posting style:** Carefully curated "solo female traveler thriving" content
- **Last post before death:** Sunset from the hostel rooftop with caption "Colombian magic. Cartagena, you've stolen my heart."

### Online vs Reality
Posts show a confident solo traveler living her best life. Reality: She hasn't slept well in weeks, her medication ran out three days ago, and she didn't want to navigate a Colombian pharmacy alone. She's more tired than she's ever been.

## Relationships

### Family
- Mother (Fiona): Agoraphobic, calls daily with worry, their relationship is strained by Sienna's "recklessness"
- Father (Angus): More supportive but defers to mother's anxiety
- Brother (Callum): The only one who truly supports her traveling, they text memes daily

### Friends
- Has travel friends but keeps them at arm's length about personal stuff
- Uni friends have drifted since she started traveling full-time

### Romantic
- Single by choice. Ended a relationship two years ago because he "worried too much"

### At the Hostel
- Popular in common areas, good at solo traveler small talk
- Gets along with everyone but lets no one in
- Specifically doesn't mention her sleepwalking to her dorm mates

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes exhausted. Third night without proper sleep. Considers finding a pharmacy but decides she'll manage. Spends the day exploring the old city, taking photos, pushing through exhaustion.

### Their Last Normal Moment
9 PM, on the rooftop bar, genuinely enjoying the view and conversation with other travelers. For a moment, she feels perfectly content. She goes to bed early for once, falls asleep instantly, deeply.

### Final Thoughts
She's not conscious during the fatal action. But in her dream, she's walking toward the ocean. The beach is beautiful. The water is warm. She's going to swim at last.

### Last Words
None spoken consciously. In her dream, she might have whispered "almost there."

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Exit routes (old habit from sleepwalking anxiety), solo female safety concerns, anything that might prompt "concern" from others
- They ignore: Her own exhaustion, warning signs about her condition, the open balcony doors
- They judge: Anyone who seems fragile, limited, or overly cautious

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [ ] Introduction scene establishing archetype (arriving solo, deflecting concern from another traveler)
- [ ] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) - lying about her sleepwalking to a concerned dorm mate
- [ ] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) - phone call with brother where her walls come down briefly
- [ ] Warning ignored scene - realizes medication is out, decides to "power through"
- [ ] Point of no return - falls asleep in a room with an unlocked balcony door
- [ ] The death
